    "### What is Sentiment Analysis—Opinion Mining?\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis also known as Opinion Mining is a field within Natural Language Processing (NLP) that builds systems that try to identify and extract opinions within text. Usually, besides identifying the opinion, these systems extract attributes of the expression e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polarity**: if the speaker express a positive or negative opinion,\n",
    "- **Subject**: the thing that is being talked about,\n",
    "- **Opinion holder**: the person, or entity that expresses the opinion.\n"

    "### What Is an Opinion?\n",
    "Text information can be broadly categorized into two main types: **facts** and **opinions**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Facts** are objective expressions about something. \n",
    "- **Opinions** are usually subjective expressions that describe people’s sentiments, appraisals, and feelings toward a subject or topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis, just as many other NLP problems, can be modeled as a *classification* problem where two sub-problems must be resolved:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classifying a sentence as *subjective* or *objective*, known as **subjectivity classification**.\n",
    "- Classifying a sentence as expressing a *positive*, *egative* or *neutral opinion*, known as **polarity classification**."
